**Vision (≤256 chars):**
> AI trading agents waste weeks rebuilding data + execution plumbing. Smart Money Trading ships the brain: 6 AI personas + a learned Judge read CoinMarketCap data, decide, explain every call, and trade autonomously on BNB Chain via Trust Wallet.

## Details
**Smart Money Trading (SMT)** is a transparent, multi-persona AI trading agent. Six specialist
personas (order-flow, technical, on-chain/whale, sentiment, regime) + a learned **Judge** turn market
data into one auditable decision, with a ≤500-char "why" on every call.

- **Track 2 — Strategy Skill:** a **CoinMarketCap-data Skill** that turns market state into a
  backtestable strategy spec — our regime + multi-persona scoring authored as an LLM Skill.
- **Track 1 — Autonomous Trading:** the SMT brain reads CMC data, decides, and a **Trust Wallet
  Agent Kit** adapter signs + executes on **BSC**, fully self-custodial, inside hard risk guardrails:
  an **un-disableable fee floor**, a drawdown cap, per-trade + daily limits, and a token allowlist.

**Why it wins on the criteria:** real on-chain execution (BSC tx hashes), a genuinely hands-off
self-custodial loop (TWAK signing end-to-end), and a learning loop (Bayesian opt + a regime bandit
seeded from logged history) that tunes the engine from realized PnL. Transparency is the
differentiator — every trade ships with its reasoning.
